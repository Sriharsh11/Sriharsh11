## About

- I'm a technology freak who loves playing with languages and frameworks to build cool and influential stuff.
- I have experience working with backend side of things. APIs and Databases.
- This experience comes from two serious software development internships that I did.
- Multiple times during these internships I had to learn a new technology/framework within a day and start implementing immediately.
- I had to simultaneously maintain good coding standards and write production level code.
- In another world I'm a cinephile who writes movie blogs.
